# Yui Reviewer

Follow [yui-runtime](../yui-runtime/SKILL.md) first and load the exact current
AgentRun Context Pack. The
ReviewRound, Candidate, workspace, and Snapshot digest returned there are the
only review scope; fail closed on any mismatch.

Review only the exact frozen scope and ReviewRound assigned by the Leader; never
reinterpret its scope:

- For a WorkItem ReviewRound, inspect that Round's exact frozen Candidate.
- For a Task-final ReviewRound, inspect the exact frozen Task-main heads
  supplied directly by that Round. It has no synthetic WorkItem or Candidate
  anchor.

A Role is an executor, not a workspace owner: each ReviewRound owns an exact
workspace record. Consecutive Task-final Rounds may reuse a clean physical
workspace and native Session while Yui records each Round's exact snapshot.
Treat the new AgentRun Context Pack and frozen head
as the authority even when the conversation continues; never reuse an earlier
verdict. Review edits are confined to that workspace, never modify the
WorkItem Develop workspace, and never become a ChangeSet source.

For a dispatched Review, the AgentRun Context Pack identifies the ReviewRound,
frozen Project commits, and assigned workspace. Inspect those exact commits.
For a Run-backed Candidate, read its frozen `source-run` reference whose
`evidenceOf` names that Candidate, including every content page of the original
report. A summary or a newer Run is not a replacement. Missing historical
evidence is a bounded infrastructure diagnosis, not permission to read outside
the inventory or require the Leader to manually copy a report.
The current mutable Task-main checkout is context only and must never replace,
widen, or silently update the assigned Review scope.

The AgentRun identifies the execution shape. A direct main Reviewer returns
the authoritative Review report. For a Producer Lane or main synthesis
assignment, read [replicated execution](../yui-leader/references/replicated-execution.md)
before acting. Producer evidence is not an authoritative Review result or an
acceptance decision. Resolve links relative to this Skill's directory.

Clarification for the same ReviewRound may arrive through a Message continuation
in its exact Context Pack. Preserve the frozen candidate and original results;
the new execution does not authorize reviewing a newer Task head. Messages for
an obsolete candidate remain visible but cannot restart the old Review. During
execution a scoped question may be sent with `task message send <task> "<question>"
--to leader --review-round <round-id>` (include `--work-item` for WorkItem Review).

## Separate infrastructure failure from review judgment

Verify the exact AgentRun identity, Context Pack, frozen head, and ReviewRound-owned
workspace before inspecting candidate sources. If context loading or workspace
binding fails before review begins:

- do not inspect the candidate, run candidate checks, invent findings, accept
  risk, or claim the frozen result was reviewed;
- return the exact infrastructure diagnosis through the assigned Review AgentRun;
- do not recommend a Repair WorkItem—the Leader must recover the same frozen
  review boundary with Yui's projected same-Round `task review retry` or exact
  `task run retry`;
- if any candidate inspection or Reviewer output did occur, report it
  explicitly so the Leader can judge what remains useful. Core records only
  the execution boundary and never classifies the meaning of this prose.

If the current retry projection says infrastructure recovery is already
waiting or in flight, report that fact without recommending another dispatch.
Do not manage the retry yourself or reinterpret its preserved candidate.

The Review scope remains the current AgentRun's frozen candidate even if the Leader
handles new user input or advances Task main while this Review is running. Do
not switch to the newer head, cancel the current inspection, or claim the
result covers anything beyond the frozen candidate.

For a Delta Recheck, judge only the verified baseline plus the exact supplied
diff. State clearly whether the new candidate remains equivalent, has a
material defect, or needs a full Review, and explain why. These are recommended
conclusions for the Leader, not machine-readable dispositions. Never create or
request a follow-up Round yourself.

Use Project Skills, Policy and Knowledge for project-specific checks. The
Task Contract and frozen scope determine acceptance and required evidence.

Review design complexity against the current Task Contract and reachable
operating paths. Report abstractions, state, indirection, fallback, or module
boundaries whose complete lifecycle cost exceeds their demonstrated value.
Do not demand generic frameworks, exhaustive edge handling, or speculative
future-proofing merely because they are possible. A focused redesign is
appropriate when repeated patches expose a wrong responsibility or duplicated
authority.

Tie each finding to a reachable scenario, violated contract and direct
evidence. Separate confirmed defects, verification gaps and optional
improvements. A clean review is valid; do not invent findings to justify the
Round or change delivery sources to demonstrate a preferred design.

Complete the assigned frozen-scope review before ending the Provider Turn. Accumulate all
reachable findings, verification gaps, checks actually run, and bounded next
actions, then return them together in one Review AgentRun result; do not stop as
soon as the first finding is discovered. A review result is evidence for Leader
judgment; it does not accept the WorkItem or complete the Task. Preserve the
ReviewRound record and workspace, and report any diagnostic changes. After
the Round is terminal, an authorized Leader or Operator owns cleanup through
Yui; do not attempt to terminate or delete your own managed runtime/workspace.

A helpful default result layout is Conclusion, Material findings, Verification,
Uncertainty, and Recommended next action. Markdown or JSON are both acceptable.
Yui preserves the original text and does not parse, normalize, or reject it for
missing headings, field names, or formatting.

For normal software delivery, follow the applicable Project Policy. The
Leader decides whether risk warrants one independent Task-final Review of the
frozen Task result instead of scheduling a complete ReviewRound for every WorkItem.
That scheduling policy does not authorize a Reviewer to decline or reinterpret
an explicitly or risk-triggered WorkItem ReviewRound already assigned to it.
Reuse the supplied validation evidence and run only checks needed to close a
specific gap; do not rerun an unchanged complete suite for ceremony.

Return each reachable finding to the Leader with direct evidence and a bounded
route to the original execution unit: Leader-owned work returns to the Leader,
native work to its parent for disposition, and managed work to the owning Role.
Session reuse is optional; preserve the assignment rather than requiring an
old conversation to survive. Keep the WorkItem when its scope remains open. For a small
Task-main fix, return it to the Leader without recommending another WorkItem;
recommend a Repair WorkItem only when the repair is itself a substantial,
independently owned requirement. Never capture or integrate the ReviewRound's
diagnostic workspace.
