# Record external delivery

Use this after creating, updating, closing, reopening or merging a PR/MR
within existing user authorization. This procedure does not grant permission
to push, publish, merge, query an external provider or archive.

## Post-completion routing boundary

Local completion is not remote delivery, and a retained Leader Session is not
an open notification lane. In the current CLI, `operator submit --task <task>`
and unaddressed `task message send|queue` refuse a completed Task before saving
new input. `--intent record` does not bypass this. Leader notification scheduling
admits only Draft/active, execution-enabled Tasks. `--to leader` requires an
existing WorkItem/ReviewRound Assignment; it is not a terminal-Task workaround.
`task execution start` and `task upstream integrate` do not continue completed
Tasks either.

The current API therefore has no ordinary Operator-to-Leader delivery-message
path that both keeps the Task completed and starts follow-up execution.
Report this precise gap when that handoff is needed. Do not fabricate a Run,
silently reopen, replace a Session to bypass lifecycle, or create a second
delivery Task merely to avoid the refusal. `task reopen` is an explicit return
to active work, not delivery-only messaging: it clears current completion fields
while retaining prior completion events. It is not the default for publishing
an already-accepted result; a genuinely authorized reopening must preserve that
history and state its acceptance impact.

This does not revoke a current Leader Session or prohibit separately authorized
atomic Publication operations supported for completed, unarchived Tasks.
Recording, diff/adopt and verification preserve acceptance evidence; none
provides the missing execution handoff or authorizes code changes. Direct
conversation still follows the Leader's lifecycle, Session and scope boundaries.

## Record and verify the owning Task's publication

Immediately record the confirmed operation with `yui task publication upsert`.
Supply only facts already known from the operation; do not defer recording to
another Role or depend on provider-specific discovery. Keep it with the Task
whose result is delivered; do not duplicate the same PR/MR across Tasks to
substitute for missing ownership or acceptance evidence.

Track PR/MR identity, state, commits, URL, merge time and evidence, not CI or
deployment status. After merge, use `yui task publication verify` only when
current authorization covers that external provider read. Otherwise retain
reported evidence and state the verification gap.

Keep the completion head as the original acceptance evidence. If an authorized
post-completion integration produced a different publication candidate, record
its exact local commit, then read `task publication diff <task>/<publication>`.
Inspect the complete delta against the original acceptance, including removals,
conflict resolutions and additional changes. Only when that candidate still
satisfies the result and its relevant increments are accepted, record
`task publication adopt <task>/<publication> --reviewed-diff <sha256> --acceptance <text>`.
Explain the semantic judgment and verification/review evidence in the acceptance.
When an existing Task Integration produced that exact candidate, include
`--integration <id>` in diff and adopt to bind its committed evidence.
Ancestry or Integration success alone is not acceptance; do not reopen the Task,
rewrite completion, or mark a merge verified to bridge an evidence gap.

Adoption records a fixed decision, not remote verification or publication
authority. The verify operation observes the exact Publication candidate through
its provider and records contrary head/state facts as reported successors,
invalidating previous verification. Metadata and verification updates may retain
adoption while the candidate is unchanged; a changed candidate needs a new
decision. Archived history is read-only to these adopt/verify operations.

Use `yui task remote-delivery <task>` to explain external delivery. Publication
is not Candidate acceptance, Review, Integration or Task completion.

## Archive separately

Completion does not authorize archive. The Operator obtains authorization for
the exact Task, checks archive eligibility, then uses `--integrated` for verified
merged delivery or `--abandon` for deliberate non-delivery. General archive
approval never implies `--force` authority. Preserve the Task record.

With explicit force authorization for a completed or cancelled (retired) Task, use
`yui task archive <task> (--integrated|--abandon) --force`. Force commits the
archive and stops new Task scheduling before attempting safe foreground cleanup.
Missing/stale delivery evidence, unresolved execution and cleanup errors become
warnings with retained resource references; they do not block that commit.
Authority, lifecycle, identity and mandatory audit persistence still fail closed.

Force does not verify a merge, accept work, stop unknown execution, discard dirty
data or imply abandonment. Keep the requested disposition and original
Publication/completion evidence. Unverified local commits and resources that
cannot be safely released stay owned and traceable. Late runtime events remain
source evidence, not authority to resume or settle unknown input.

Read `task show <task> --json` for `data.archive.warnings`,
`data.archive.retainedResources` and `data.archive.cleanupEvents`;
`task context` also retains the original records/events. A successful archive
exit means `archived=true`, not that cleanup fully succeeded. `cleanupFinished`
means the foreground pass finished, not that every resource was removed.
If cleanup was interrupted, the Task stays archived. Repeating archive only
reports current facts; use explicit, exact-owner resource operations after
inspection instead of re-running broad cleanup. No background retry is implied.
