# Record external delivery

Use this after creating, updating, closing, reopening or merging a PR/MR
within existing user authorization. This procedure does not grant permission
to push, publish, merge, query an external provider or archive.

Immediately record the confirmed operation with `yui task publication upsert`.
Supply only facts already known from the operation; do not defer recording to
another Role or depend on provider-specific discovery.

Track PR/MR identity, state, commits, URL, merge time and evidence, not CI or
deployment status. After merge, use `yui task publication verify` only when
current authorization covers that external provider read. Otherwise retain
reported evidence and state the verification gap.

Use `yui task remote-delivery <task>` to explain external delivery. Publication
is not Candidate acceptance, Review, Integration or Task completion.

Completion does not authorize archive. The Operator obtains authorization for
the exact Task, checks archive eligibility, then uses `--integrated` for verified
merged delivery or `--abandon` for deliberate non-delivery. General archive
approval never implies `--force` authority. Preserve the Task record.

With explicit force authorization for a completed or retired Task, use
`yui task archive <task> (--integrated|--abandon) --force`. Force commits the
archive and stops new Task scheduling before attempting safe foreground cleanup.
Missing/stale delivery evidence, unresolved execution and cleanup errors become
warnings with retained resource references; they do not block that commit.
Authority, lifecycle, identity and mandatory audit persistence still fail closed.

Force does not verify a merge, accept work, stop unknown execution, discard dirty
data or imply abandonment. Keep the requested disposition and original
Publication/completion evidence. Unverified local commits and resources that
cannot be safely released stay owned and traceable. Late runtime events remain
source evidence, not authority to resume or settle unknown input.

Read `task show <task> --json` for `archive.warnings`, `retainedResources` and
cleanup events; `task context` also retains the original records/events. A
successful archive exit means `archived=true`, not that cleanup fully succeeded.
If cleanup was interrupted, the Task stays archived. Repeating archive only
reports current facts; use explicit, exact-owner resource operations after
inspection instead of re-running broad cleanup. No background retry is implied.
