# Runtime recovery

Read this when a native Turn fails, delivery acceptance is unknown, the
Controller is unavailable, or an authorized supervisor chooses Session
replacement. Workers and Reviewers report exact evidence; they do not acquire
supervisor authority by reading this procedure.

## Inspect the failed execution

Read the referenced `runtime.agent-error`, exact AgentRun, Role Session and
affected WorkItem, ReviewRound or Integration. Use `task next-action` and
`execution audit` as decision support, not as an automatic plan.
Active or quiet observations are not a Task-wide lock or proof of failure.

### Configuration and model-name failures

The already-running caller handles a failed launch: Worker/Reviewer failures
go to their Leader, and an unavailable Leader's failure goes to the existing
Operator channel. A target that did not start cannot repair itself. Read the
referenced error once; do not create a recovery Agent, a polling loop or a new
Task merely to handle it.

Use the error's capability-query pointer to inspect native metadata with the
recorded failed configuration:

```sh
yui task event show <task> <error-event>
yui task role capabilities <task> <role> --error <error-event> --refresh
```

The query uses the Controller's Provider environment, not your own Agent's
possibly different account variables, and requires that Controller to be running.
It preserves the requested model, workspace, profile/settings selection and
configured Agent identity. Native settings files and credentials are still read
currently, not copied into error history. A historical error without a recorded
configuration, or a changed Agent command/bindings, returns a diagnosis instead
of borrowing today's Role configuration. To inspect the desired next launch
explicitly, omit `--error`. Distinguish live, cached and unavailable metadata.
Do not treat an alias list as a complete Provider whitelist.

Reconcile the original user requirement with exact native IDs and alias
mappings. Correcting the name of the same authorized model is routine recovery;
selecting another model, account, permission or cost boundary is not. If there
is no proven equivalent, preserve the failure and report the missing choice.
Do not guess names, select a similarly named variant, or silently fall back.

After correcting only the intended configuration, choose the existing operation
that matches current facts. A rejected notification retains its input:

```sh
yui task wake show <task> <wake>
yui task wake retry <task> <wake> --reason "<correction and evidence>"
```

Retry does not replace a Session or change its immutable effective configuration.
If an existing Session must adopt changed settings, use the deliberate Session
replacement operation below; an assigned Run uses its own legal retry operation.
Accepted or uncertain input cannot be replayed through notification retry.
Configuration failure is not transient infrastructure recovery, and unchanged
configuration does not justify another attempt.

### Bounded infrastructure retry

The Controller, not the Agent, counts and schedules qualifying transient
Provider retries: at most five automatic executions after the initial failure,
within one ten-minute recovery window. Native acceptance, activity and partial
output do not reset that count. Unknown delivery remains fenced for exact
readback; it is never replayed.

Inspect the current projection in Context, or use
`task role session retry <task> <role> show`; Global Sessions use
`session retry <role> show`. While `waiting` or `in-flight`, do not dispatch a
duplicate. A readable failed Run remains immutable evidence while its recovery
successor handles the same responsibility and frozen Review boundary.

`cancel` withdraws pending automatic recovery; `disable` additionally disables
future automatic chains on that Provider binding. Neither stops an admitted
native Turn. `enable` permits future failures to qualify, without replaying
old failures. These controls require the existing user/supervisor authority.

`exhausted`, `cancelled` and `needs-attention` preserve the error, input and
work. Read their exact reason, then choose an authorized next action. Unsupported
Hosts/Adapters or unprovable Session/background state do not trigger automatic
replacement, cleanup, model switching or a new grant.

A failed AgentRun is immutable; retry creates a new attempt. Reuse a recoverable
Session when useful and load the new attempt's current context, not an old
Assignment from memory. A new Host process need not mean a new native Session.
Preserve frozen Review candidates and selected synthesis sources on retry.
An infrastructure failure is not a defect in the business result.

## Replace a Session deliberately

An authorized Leader or Operator may request:

```sh
yui task role session new <task> <role> --reason "<reason>"
```

The old Run may still be active, the Session may already be released, or fresh
context may simply be preferable. Save necessary requirements, decisions,
progress and results first. Yui persists replacement intent, stops the exact
execution and retires its engineering attempts while retaining Task history and
workspaces. Do not manipulate Run status, delete context or change models to
make replacement legal.

When replacing yourself, end the native turn. The successor reads durable Task
context and fixed notification references, then chooses which still-valid
assignment to continue. Released Leaders retain scoped diagnostic reads but
cannot regain write authority.

## Handle uncertainty and failed cleanup

Never replay a notification whose acceptance is unknown. After evidence
establishes shared-native quiescence, an authorized supervisor can use:

```sh
yui task wake resolve <task> <wake> --reason "<quiescence evidence>"
```

This releases only the claim, preserves the original unknown record, and lets
independent later inputs proceed. It neither asserts acceptance nor implements
the Message. Uncertain native activity still blocks conflicting execution;
unrelated authorized local work can continue.

If the Controller is unresponsive, an authorized Operator can use
`controller status` and explicit `controller restart` without a successful
preliminary RPC. Preserve the resource and restart authorization boundary.
If exact native stop or inspection fails, read the persisted diagnostic and
resolve that resource boundary; do not kill arbitrary processes, clear unknown
execution records, or modify managed refs, tmux Sessions or state files.

After repeated failure of the same bounded recovery, report the observed
cause, impact and smallest remaining options. Do not broaden cleanup or add
a private retry loop. A failed recovery does not erase the pending requirement.
