 * Issue 07: delta-recheck protocol.
 *
 * A delta-recheck is a Task-final ReviewRound that rechecks a proven diff on
 * top of an already-accepted frozen head.  It never copies the old
 * acceptance: the new head always receives a fresh Reviewer disposition, and
 * any uncertainty returns to the Leader. The control plane enforces only the
 * technical evidence boundary (accepted baseline, contiguous base, exact
 * scope and reproducible diff).
