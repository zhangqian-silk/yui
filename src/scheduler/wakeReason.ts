/**
 * Canonical taxonomy for Leader wake reasons.
 *
 * The leader-role WorkMailbox pending batch is the durable aggregation bucket;
 * it stores reason tags as strings. This module is the single taxonomy that
 * producers use to build those tags and that the wake envelope uses to render
 * them together with their record references. The mailbox stays a generic
 * queue — the wake layer owns the meaning of its tags.
 *
 * Tag wire format: `<kind>` or `<kind>:<ref>`. The ref is an exact record
 * identifier (InputRequest id, AgentRun id, ...) or, for `force-wake`, the
 * operator-supplied text. Unknown kinds parse losslessly so a newer producer
 * can never wedge an older reader.
