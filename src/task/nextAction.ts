/**
 * Issue 07 (Leader convergence): a read-only decision-support projection for
 * the Task Leader. It folds durable Task records into one recommended action,
 * while preserving legitimate alternatives and the points that require Leader
 * judgment instead of pretending that storage state alone owns the decision.
 *
 * This module is deliberately pure: it never starts a Controller, writes a
 * record, or performs a Git inspection. Every value is derived from records
 * that already exist. Hard protocol conflicts remain conservative — when the
 * records do not support safe execution, the projection returns
 * `repair-protocol-inconsistency` with the conflicting records instead of
 * guessing.
