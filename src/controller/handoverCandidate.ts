/**
 * Controller handover candidate prelude (Issue 02).
 *
 * A handover candidate is the new release's Controller process started while
 * the old Controller still owns the Home. It does NOT bind the main socket or
 * run the scheduler: it proves the new release starts, publishes its identity
 * receipt, and waits until the old owner exits AND the active release pointer
 * names its release. Only then does it promote itself by starting the full
 * Controller runtime in-process.
 *
 * If the old owner stays live after the commit (a stuck Controller), the
 * candidate stays read-only and reports `dualOwner: true` in its identity
 * receipt; it never writes while another owner is live.
