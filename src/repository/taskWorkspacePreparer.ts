 * cwd, and a native conversation is bound to the cwd it started in. Such a
 * Session cannot continue, and that is not a failure to report — the plan lives
 * in the Task's own durable facts, so the next Turn takes over from persistent
 * Context instead of the old terminal or its full tool log.
 *
 * Ending the record here is what makes the takeover explicit rather than
 * silent: the next Leader wake resolves `new`, and the queued cleanup ends the
 * physical Host that the ended record no longer represents. Without this, a
 * live planning Session would make workspace migration throw and leave the
