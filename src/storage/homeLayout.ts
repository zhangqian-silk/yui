 * user-facing `defaultWorkspace` (an out-of-Home directory), and provider
 * runtimes/backups were written to string-built siblings of Home
 * (`${home}.task-runtimes`, `${home}-backups`). Both are unified here so that a
 * single canonical YUI_HOME contains all self-managed data, with only the
 * approved short-path IPC sockets (Controller, tmux, Agent Host, integration
 * runtime) remaining outside it for the `sockaddr_un` length budget. Within the
 * managed workspace root, storage v20 further collapses the former
 * physical-worktree/symlink-view split into a single layer of real worktrees
 * under `tasks/` (see {@link managedTaskRoot}).
 *
 * `defaultWorkspace` is intentionally NOT an input to this module: it remains a
 * user-facing cwd for ad-hoc/global Roles and the origin for external Project
 * input, never a second authority for internal managed layout.
