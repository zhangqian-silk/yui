/**
 * Real {@link UpdatePorts} for `yui update`: side-by-side npm staging plus a
 * staged-binary path-specific read-only preflight, wired into the recoverable
 * orchestration in {@link runUpdate}.
 *
 * Staging installs the latest package into a throwaway prefix with
 * `npm install --global --prefix <tmp>`, so the live global install is never
 * touched until the binary-activation step. Preflight invokes the STAGED binary's
 * internal `yui upgrade --update-preflight` contract so the target version
 * proves that the Home is current or has a complete supported migration path.
 * After the parent stops the exact old Controller, the binary is promoted,
 * required migrations run through that same staged artifact, and the activated
 * binary verifies the resulting current Home.
 *
 * Two hardening guarantees this module enforces:
 *
 *  - **Promote the SAME artifact that was staged (P1-3).** `stage` resolves the
 *    exact version it installed from the staged package's own metadata; both the
 *    `StagedPackage.version` and `activateBinary` use that pinned version
 *    (`@zq-silk/yui@<version>`), never a second bare `@latest` that could resolve
 *    to a different build than the one that passed preflight.
 *  - **Verify the ACTUALLY-ACTIVATED binary (P1-3).** `verify` resolves the live
 *    global `yui` (via `npm prefix -g`), runs its `--json doctor`, AND confirms
 *    the promoted binary's reported version matches the staged version. A
 *    mismatch fails closed.
