/**
 * Per-Task local-only Git artifact repository.
 *
 * This is the authority for a Task's file/directory artifacts: complete plans,
 * prototypes, charts, reports and other multi-file material. It is a plain
 * local Git repository under `<YUI_HOME>/task-artifacts/<task-id>/` with:
 *
 *   - NO remote of any kind (network or file). A remote appearing in the repo
 *     is treated as an external violation: {@link assertNoRemote} reports it and
 *     stops managed writes; the configuration is never silently removed.
 *   - a hardened, isolated Git subprocess (see {@link managedGit}) that cannot
 *     reach the network, run hooks/filters, or read ambient user/system config.
 *   - fixed committer identity and an empty root commit, so HEAD always exists
 *     and per-path scoped commits work uniformly from the first real save.
 *
 * Save model (§3.4): write file(s) → validate scope → local commit → saved.
 * A successful commit IS the save; there is no DB round-trip on the write path.
 * Uncommitted changes are work-in-progress. A commit failure preserves the
 * files exactly and surfaces the precise error — nothing is reset or cleaned.
 * One meaningful update is one commit. A short per-Task lock plus an
 * expected-HEAD check make concurrent saves safe; a conflict STOPS (no
 * overwrite, no auto-merge). Branches/PRs/rebase are never exposed.
 *
 * Artifacts are savable from the Draft stage: this store depends only on the
 * Home, never on an active delivery workspace or Project checkout.
