/**
 * Atomic Controller handover orchestration (Issue 02).
 *
 * The activator (`yui release activate`) drives one versioned handover:
 *
 *   preflight (read-only) -> handover lock -> fence the old Controller
 *   -> start the candidate -> read back its identity -> switch the active
 *   release pointer -> commit the old Controller -> wait for promotion
 *   -> handover receipt.
 *
 * Every phase is recoverable from the durable fence + pointer state. A failed
 * candidate rolls back to the old Controller; a stuck old Controller leaves
 * the candidate read-only and reports dual-owner; a crashed activator resumes
 * from the recorded phase.
