/**
 * Durable adapter-level idempotency for the real release-workflow adapter.
 *
 * The engine already prevents duplicate effects within a workflow run (it
 * never re-submits a step it has marked terminal, and re-attempts after a
 * crash are serialized by a cross-process lock). The residual window is the
 * crash AFTER the external effect landed but BEFORE the engine persisted the
 * step result: a resumed process re-invokes `executeStep` under the same
 * idempotency key, and without this store the shell command runs a second
 * time. This store makes `executeStep` idempotent across processes: a
 * recorded successful effect is replayed instead of re-executed.
 *
 * Only SUCCEEDED effects are recorded. A failed effect produced no confirmed
 * landing (and the engine retries failed steps), so caching it would strand
 * recoverable failures; a timeout is re-queried authoritatively by the
 * engine and re-executed only when the effect is proven absent.
 *
 * Layout
 * ------
 * Each key is its own record file under `release-idempotency/`, named by the
 * percent-encoded key. There is deliberately no whole-map cache and no
 * whole-file rewrite: two processes that record different keys touch
 * different files, so neither can clobber the other, and a process that
 * crashes mid-write leaves at most one stale temp file (the atomic
 * temp+rename in `writeTextFileAtomically` never exposes a partial record).
 * The temp filename carries the writer pid and a UUID, so two processes
 * never share a temp pathname.
 *
 * Every record carries `schemaVersion: 1`. A record whose version is unknown,
 * whose key does not match the file it was read from, or whose effect is not
 * a succeeded effect fails closed (the read throws) rather than being
 * silently skipped: at-most-once cannot be proven from a corrupt record.
 *
 * A persistence failure is propagated, never swallowed. The adapter converts
 * an unpersisted success into an ambiguous/fail-closed outcome; reporting
 * success for an effect whose dedup record did not land would let a crash
 * re-run the effect.
